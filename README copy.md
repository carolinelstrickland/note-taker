# Note-Taker Application
 
  ## Description

  This is an express.js based application. From the CLI, the user makes a connection to PORT 3005 via Local Host. Once that connection is established, from the client, the user can visit https://localhost:3005 to view the landing page for the note application. The user can select the get started button and add and delete new notes as desired. The notes will be saved as long as the PORT connection is established.
